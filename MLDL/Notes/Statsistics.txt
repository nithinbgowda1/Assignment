Statistics involves two parts:
1. Inferential: We always try to find relation between samples and population. Based on relation we make conclusion. Population is the one on which experiement is performed. Sample is subset of population.
2. Descriptive: Can be described and summarized using numbers and graphs. We always think of central tedency of data. Central tedency includes mean, median, mode. Some pattern is displayed in the graph.


Descriptive involves cateogrical and numerical data in dataset.
Categorical defines group of data. Data which can be categorized. 
Numerical can be present in terms of numbers.

Categorical and Numerical can be divided as:
	1. Continuous: Data is continuous
	2. Discrete: Data are discrete. Data is described absoulety completly.	

For eg: Student scoring if said in terms of Grade then cateogrical, when score is termend in terms of marks then numerical data.

Level of measurements:
Able to divide data in two parts :
	1. Qualitative: Quallty of data is involved. Can be divided as 
			1. Nominal: Values serves only as a label. For eg: Considering male as 1 and female as 0, we are just trying to give representation.Just a name there is no order
			2. Ordinal: There is some kind of order
	2. Quantitative: Quantity of data is involved. Can be divided as
			1. Interval: Data defined in term of interval
			2. Ratio: Data defined in term of ratio

Central tedency: Involves
	1. Mean:
	2. Median:
	3. Mode:
